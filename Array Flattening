// We have created a variable arrayflattened which will store the flattened array
// explanation of arraynested.flat(Infinity); : 
// here we have use flat() method which is part of JavaScript's built-in Array methods, to flatten a deeply nested array
// What it does is that it creates a new array where all sub-array elements are flattened into a single layer along with the top level elements
// The argument passed to flat() determines how deeply nested arrays should be flattened
// here we have passed the argument as infinity to flatten a nested array of any depth

console.log(arrayflattened); // Print the flattened array on the console
